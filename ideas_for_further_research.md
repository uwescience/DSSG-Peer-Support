title: Ideas for Further Research

* An examination of whether extreme suicidal or non-suicidal self-injury content affects the content of users who have seen the post and created their own posts shortly after.
* A comparative examination of the content of comments for those who have received additional motivational interviewing training before and after the training.
* Research into the long term impact and helpfulness of peer support platforms by incorporating mental health assessments at periodic intervals of user engagement with such platforms.
* Further study of how certain platform features may increase or affect prosocial behavior. For instance, one of the things that we encountered on the platform is that individuals who posted anonymously tended to exhibit troll-like behavior. We also found that users who posted anonymously tended to ask questions pertaining to pregnancy or LGBT issues. Understanding the relative benefits of these design choices could extend to other social networking platforms.
