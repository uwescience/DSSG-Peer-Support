# Abstract or executive summary
Everyone encounters challenges in life – whether that includes stress from school or work or more significant problems like depression and addiction.  When we hit these challenges, we often reach out to friends and family for emotional support and problem-solving help. Peer support is an extension of this and has a long and well-researched history as a first line of intervention for mental health and addiction problems. Traditionally, peer support was in-person, but technology advances mean that support can be ‘crowdsourced’ and scaffolded and thus taken to scale. Online peer-support platforms, with precisely this goal, use technology to take effective peer-support to scale.

However, by its nature, peers are not licensed counselors, and thus, it is critical to provide feedback on what really works and is helpful vs. what might be very well-intentioned… but not so helpful.  Our Data Science for the Social Good project will focus on using data from an online peer support platform to better understand what types of responses — offering support on the TalkLife platform — are the most helpful to young adults sharing their struggles online. We will pursue this objective by analyzing a large-scale dataset of around 200 million posts and interactions on the platform. We then want to use these insights to develop tools and trainings for peers to help them be as helpful as they can when supporting others in need. We further anticipate that these insights could be useful in “offline,” on-the-ground mental health care as well, for instance in training counselors. Any insights into peer support developed during this project could potentially impact over 500 thousand platform users that are currently suffering from mental health issues.
